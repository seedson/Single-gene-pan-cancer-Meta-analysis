In this repository, we share data and R code for :

1. Evaluation of whether expression of a gene is changed in cancer(s) compared with controls.
data:Low_CFTR_OR.txt
R code:Expression meta-analysis

2.Evaluation of the impact of a gene expression on cancer(s) survival.
data:CFTR_OV.txt
R code:Meta-analysis-survival

Please input your data with the same format as example data, and change the colume names in both data and R code accordingly.
